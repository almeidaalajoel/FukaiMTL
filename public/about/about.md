Hello! That cool guy on the toadstool up there is me, Bicksy. I guess you could call it a bicksystool (ha-ha!). I made this site after I realized how good machine translation has gotten these days, and that even I (with a small knowledge of Japanese) could copy and paste (or rather, make a script that does it for me :P) and edit the results. Hopefully the end product has turned into something decent. I've started with <span className = "font-bold">Tilea's Worries</span> because it's a series that I always was sad got dropped, and I personally wanted to read more. My goal is to at least finish volume 3 (which goes to chapter 85). After that, I might continue, translate something else, or quit altogether. It really depends on my motivation (which will likely depend on the feedback I get).

I wrote the code for this site myself, and I haven't done extensive testing across different target devices, so if anything looks funky or doesn't work, don't hesitate to shoot me a message. If you're using a screen reader and you're having any issues, please message me! I don't want anyone to have a hard time using the site. Any feature requests you'd like to see are welcome as well. And if you like my (coding) work here and are in need of a NextJS/React/React Native (among others) developer, I am open to messages about that as well, hehe ;).

Anyway, go ahead and message me about anything at <span className="font-bold text-slate-500">fukaiMTL@gmail.com</span>
