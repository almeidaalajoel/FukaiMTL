# **Recap/Characters**

Tilea discovered her sister Timu (really demon Camilla) going to meet up with people and thought she was a chuunibyou playing games. Camilla was meeting up with the Demon King army, but after Tilea beat her up, she became loyal to Tilea instead, splitting off from the DKA. Now Camilla and her suboordinates make up the Evil God Army (Tilea being the Evil God). The DKA still exists and has been doing something sus in another country under Hidler's command.

Tilea is almost certainly host to the Demon King, and he seems to be able to take over her body if he so chooses, having done so twice (once to save Tilea when she was passed out, once to kill people who noticed Tilea's association with demons).

Tilea and Camilla moved to the capital city because Tilea wanted Timu to go to the magic academy. Tilea opens a restaurant here. Shortly after they moved, vampires that were unrelated to the DKA or EGA (offspring of creations of Camilla from long ago) attacked the capital, causing mass chaos, only to be driven away mostly by the EGA, unbeknownst to the citizens.

After this, an exiled noble known as The Fiend due to his evil acts returns to the capital when the king (who is now under EGA control via a vampire named Edim who joined them after the attack) shows weakness. He tells Tilea that he'll kill her family if she doesn't submit to him, causing her much distress. Eventually she asks Edim (the only person from the EGA Tilea is actually aware is a demon) and Ortissio (who she thinks is a nobleman) to help her by killing The Fiend. They do so.

On their way back from killing The Fiend, Edim is discovered by two of Tilea's friends who are part of a Demon Subjugation squad. They partially convince Tilea that Edim might be up to no good. Tilea then confides in one of the members of the EGA about this, causing Edim's evaluation to plummet. This is approximately where we are now.

Characters
Tilea/Evil God - Main character. Inhabited by the Demon King and immensely powerful. Air headed and thinks that everyone around her is a chuunibyou pretending to be a demon. They are in fact all demons.
Timu/Camilla - Tilea's sister. One of the 4 demon generals in the Demon King Army. Master of magic. Completely loyal to Tilea.
Nielson - Captain of Camilla's personal guard and leader in the Evil God Army. Looked down on by Tilea as very unreliable/weak/perverted, but trusted by Camilla.
Myu/Muhen - Member of Camilla's personal guard. Trusted by Tilea as she considers him as the only responsible/adult one among a group of Chuunibyou. Master swordsman.
Ortissio - Member of Camilla's personal guard. Tried to lead a revolt against Tilea during the vampire invasion of the capital, and is therefore hated by everyone in the EGA. However, due to Tilea's intervention, he's not executed.
Remilia - Powerful Elf adventurer. Tilea's love interest, so far unrequited.
Edim - Vampire. Underling of Camilla (Tilea wanted them to be friends) but generally disliked among EGA due to weakness and later because Tilea suspected her. The only person Tilea actually knows is a demon. However, until talking to Bizef and Oujo, she was certain Edim still had her human heart (she doesn't).
Ojou/Rozetta Pratoline - Aristocrat young girl. Tilea's friend and gourmet.  
Jessica - Human student. Edim's former friend.
Lyris - Human clone of Aria, a mage. Died during the vampire invasion. Her powers and some of her memories returned to Aria after her death at the hands of the Demon King (possessing Tilea's body). However, the memories of the death were not transferred, at least not yet.
Aria - Human mage. Not much is known about her, but she seems important.
Bizef - Human swordsman. Formerly a guard of Tilea's city, but moved to the capital shortly after Tilea. In love with Tilea. Tilea looks down on him as a weakling/loser because he fainted several times when seeing powerful demons (that Tilea thought were simply dilinquents/illusion magic).
Alcyune - vampire that originally turned Edim. Dead.
Milay - chatty/gossipy woman in the capital who is friends with Tilea.
Hidler - Current leader of the DKA. Seen by Tilea as responsible and adult.
JayJay - Teacher at magic academy turned vampire by Edim.
